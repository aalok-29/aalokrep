1. The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive and miniature computer.

2. It was developed as an educational tool, and has been made available to everyone, no matter your computer expertise.

3. The Raspberry Pi is a versatile computer that can be made into just about anything.

4. If you’ve been wanting an inexpensive way to get into programming and DIY tech projects, this is an awesome place to start!

## Raspberry Pi

You are going to take a first look at Raspberry Pi! You should have a Raspberry Pi computer in front of you for this. The computer shouldn’t be connected to anything yet.

### USB ports —

these are used to connect a mouse and keyboard. You can also connect other components, such as a USB drive.

### SD card slot —

you can slot the SD card in here. This is where the operating system software and your files are stored.

### Ethernet port —

this is used to connect Raspberry Pi to a network with a cable. Raspberry Pi can also connect to a network via wireless LAN.

### Audio jack —

you can connect headphones or speakers here.

### HDMI port —

this is where you connect the monitor (or projector) that you are using to display the output from the Raspberry Pi. If your monitor has speakers, you can also use them to hear sound.

### Micro USB power connector —

this is where you connect a power supply. You should always do this last, after you have connected all your other components.

### GPIO ports —

these allow you to connect electronic components such as LEDs and buttons to Raspberry Pi.
