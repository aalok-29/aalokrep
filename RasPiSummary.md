# RASPBERRY Pi

The Raspberry Pi is a single board computer.The Raspberry Pi is a small computer that can do lots of things.Raspberry Pi was created with the goal of education in mind. This ultra-tiny computer was designed to be small and cheap so that schools could easily afford them in order to teach students about computers in the classroom. This is great for two reasons, the first is that it provides extremely cheap access to a computer, and second it is a great tool for learning more about computers.

## Raspberry Pi

You are going to take a first look at Raspberry Pi! You should have a Raspberry Pi computer in front of you for this. The computer shouldn’t be connected to anything yet.

Look at your Raspberry Pi. Can you find all the things labelled on the diagram?

### USB ports — 

these are used to connect a mouse and keyboard. You can also connect other components, such as a USB drive.

### SD card slot — 

you can slot the SD card in here. This is where the operating system software and your files are stored.

### Ethernet port — 

this is used to connect Raspberry Pi to a network with a cable. Raspberry Pi can also connect to a network via wireless LAN.

### Audio jack — 

you can connect headphones or speakers here.

### HDMI port — 
this is where you connect the monitor (or projector) that you are using to display the output from the Raspberry Pi. If your monitor has speakers, you can also use them to hear sound.

### Micro USB power connector — 

this is where you connect a power supply. You should always do this last, after you have connected all your other components.

### GPIO ports — 

these allow you to connect electronic components such as LEDs and buttons to Raspberry Pi.
